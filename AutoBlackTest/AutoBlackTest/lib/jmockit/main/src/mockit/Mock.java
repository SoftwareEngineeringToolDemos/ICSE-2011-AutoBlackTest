/**
 * Used inside a <em>mock class</em> to indicate a <em>mock method</em> whose implementation will temporarily replace
 * the implementation of a matching "real" method.
 * <p/>
 * The mock method must have the same name and the same parameters as the matching real method, except for an optional
 * first parameter of type {@link Invocation}; if this extra parameter is present, the remaining ones must match the
 * parameters in the real method.
 * The mock method must also have the same return type as the matching real method.
 * <p/>
 * Method modifiers (including <code>public</code>, <code>final</code>, and even <code>static</code>), however,
 * <em>don't</em> have to be the same.
 * Checked exceptions in the <code>throws</code> clause (if any) can also differ between the two matching methods.
 * A mock <em>method</em> can also target a <em>constructor</em>, in which case the previous considerations still apply,
 * except for the name of the mock method which must be "<code>$init</code>".
 * <p/>
 * A mock method can specify <em>constraints</em> on the number of invocations it should receive while in effect
 * (ie, from the time a real method/constructor is mocked to the time it is restored to its original definition).
 * <p/>
 * The special mock methods <strong>{@code void $init(...)}</strong> and <strong>{@code void $clinit()}</strong>
 * correspond to constructors and to {@code static} class initializers, respectively.
 * (Notice that it makes no difference if the real class contains more than one static initialization block, because the
 * compiler merges the sequence of static blocks into a single internal "&lt;clinit>" static method in the class file.)
 * Mock methods named {@code $init} will apply to the corresponding constructor in the real class, by matching the
 * declared parameters; just like regular mock methods, they can also have a first parameter of type {@link Invocation}.
