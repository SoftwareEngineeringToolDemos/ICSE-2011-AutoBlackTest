/**
 * Indicates an instance field of the test class or a parameter of the test method whose value will be an
 * <em>isolated</em> mocked instance, intended to be passed or <em>injected</em> into the code under test.
 * Such instances can be said to be proper <em>mock objects</em>, in contrast to the <em>mocked instances</em> of a
 * regular mocked type.
 * The intent is that these mock objects will be passed/injected into the tested object/unit, so that other instances
 * of the same type remain unaffected.
 * <p/>
 * The use of this annotation implies that the declared type of the mock field/parameter is a mocked type, just like it
 * would be if annotated with {@linkplain Mocked @Mocked}.
 * The {@code @Mocked} annotation can be applied at the same time, if needed.
 * The default mocking behavior, however, is different in several ways.
 * <p/>
 * For the duration of each test where the mock field/parameter is in scope, <em>only one</em> injectable instance is
 * mocked; other instances of the same mocked type are not affected.
 * For an injectable mocked <em>class</em>, <em>static methods</em> and <em>constructors</em> are <em>not</em> mocked;
 * only instance methods are.
 * <p/>
 * When used in combination with {@linkplain Tested @Tested}, the values of injectable fields and parameters will be
 * used for automatic injection into the tested object.
 * Additionally, this annotation can be applied to non-mocked fields of primitive or array type, which will also be used
 * for injection.
 *
