/**
 * A set of <em>expected</em> and/or <em>allowed</em> method/constructor invocations on the mocked types/instances that
 * have been made available to the test through mock fields and/or mock parameters.
 * <pre>
 *
 * new Expectations() {{
 *    <strong>mock1</strong>.expectedMethod(<em>anyInt</em>); <em>result</em> = 123; <em>times</em> = 2;
 *    <strong>mock2</strong>.anotherExpectedMethod(1, "test"); returns("Abc", "xyz");
 *    <strong>MockedClass</strong>.allowedMethod(); notStrict();
 * }};
 * // Now exercise the tested code according to the recorded expectations.</pre>
 * Typically, this class is used by extending it with <em>anonymous inner classes</em> (so called <em>expectation
 * blocks</em>) inside test methods, which record expectations on mocked types or instances by calling instance methods
 * on mock fields/parameters, static methods on mocked classes, and/or constructors of mocked classes.
 * Arguments passed in such calls are later matched to the actual arguments passed from the code under test.
 * <p/>
 * Any instance field declared in a subclass is considered a <em>local</em> mock field, provided it has a mockable type
 * and is either non-private or annotated with {@linkplain Mocked @Mocked}.
 * <p/>
 * There are several special fields and methods which can be used in the expectation block, to: a) record desired return
 * values or exceptions/errors to be thrown ({@link #result}, {@link #returns(Object, Object...)}); b) relax or
 * constrain the matching of argument values ({@link #anyInt}, {@link #anyString}, {@link #withNotNull()}, etc.);
 * c) relax or constrain the expected and/or allowed number of matching invocations ({@link #times}, {@link #minTimes},
 * {@link #maxTimes}).
 * <p/>
 * Individual expectations are defined during the <em>record phase</em>, and later exercised during the
 * <em>replay phase</em> of the test.
 * At the end of the test, the test runner will automatically assert that all <em>expected</em> invocations actually
 * occurred during the replay phase.
 * An expectation block may also record expectations that are merely <em>allowed</em> to occur, and as such are not
 * implicitly verified at the end of the test.
 * <p/>
 * Additional features and details:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * A <strong>mock field</strong> can be of any non-primitive type, including interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete
 * classes (even {@code final} classes).
 * An instance will be automatically created when the subclass gets instantiated, unless the field is {@code final}
 * (in which case, the test code itself will have the responsibility of obtaining an appropriate instance).
 * This mocked instance can then be used inside the expectation block for the recording of expectations on instance
 * methods; <strong>static methods</strong> and <strong>constructors</strong> belonging to the mocked class or its
 * super-classes are also mocked, and can also have expectations recorded on them.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Unless specified otherwise, all expectations defined inside an {@code Expectations} immediate subclass will be
 * <em>strict</em>, meaning that the recorded invocations are <em>expected</em> to occur in the same order during the
 * replay phase, and that non-recorded invocations are <em>not allowed</em>.
 * This default behavior can be overridden for individual expectations through the {@link #notStrict()} method, and for
 * whole mocked types through the {@link NonStrict} annotation.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * There is a set of API methods that allow the {@linkplain #newInstance(String, Class[], Object...) instantiation of
 * non-accessible (to the test) classes}, the {@linkplain #invoke(Object, String, Object...) invocation of
 * non-accessible methods}, and the {@linkplain #setField(Object, String, Object) setting of non-accessible fields}.
 * Most tests shouldn't need these facilities, though.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * By default, the exact instance on which instance method invocations occur during the replay phase is <em>not</em>
 * verified to be the same as the instance used when recording the corresponding expectation, <em>unless</em> the
 * mock field/parameter was declared to be {@linkplain Injectable @Injectable}.
 * If such verification on non-injectable instances is needed, the {@link #onInstance(Object)} method should be used.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * There are additional constructors which provide other features:
 * {@linkplain #Expectations(Object...) dynamic partial mocking}, and
 * {@linkplain #Expectations(Integer, Object...) iterated invocations}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
