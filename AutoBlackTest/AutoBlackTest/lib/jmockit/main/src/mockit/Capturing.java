/**
 * Indicates a mock field or a mock parameter for which all classes extending/implementing the mocked type will
 * <em>also</em> get mocked.
 * <p/>
 * In the case of a non-final "capturing" mock field, mocked instances will (by default) be captured and assigned to
 * the mock field as they are created.
 * Otherwise (ie, when applied to a {@code final} mock field or to a mock parameter), instances are still captured but
 * not made directly available to the test.
 * The {@link #maxInstances} attribute allows an upper limit to the number of captured instances to be specified.
 * If multiple capturing mock fields of the same type are declared, this attribute can be used so that each distinct
 * instance gets assigned to a separate field.
 * <p/>
 * Note that, once a capturing mocked type is in scope, the capture of implementation classes and their instances can
 * happen at any moment before the first expected invocation is recorded, or during the recording and replay phases.

    * for each one of them, say {@code n1}, {@code n2}, etc.
