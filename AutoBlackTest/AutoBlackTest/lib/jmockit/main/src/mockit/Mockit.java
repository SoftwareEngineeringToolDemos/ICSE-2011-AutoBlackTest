/**
 * Provides static methods for the mocking and stubbing of arbitrary classes, according to specified <em>mock
 * classes</em> defined in test code.
 * Such methods are intended to be called from test code only.
 * <p/>
 * Once mocked, a "real" method defined in a production class will behave (during test execution) as if its
 * implementation was replaced by a call to the corresponding <em>mock method</em> in the mock class.
 * Whatever value this mock method returns will be the value returned by the call to the mocked method.
 * The mock method can also throw an exception or error, which will then be propagated to the caller of the mocked
 * "real" method.
 * Therefore, while mocked the original code in the real method is never executed (actually, there's still a way to
 * execute the real implementation, although not normally used for testing purposes).
 * The same basic rules apply to constructors, which can be mocked by mock methods with the special name "$init".
 * <p/>
 * The methods in this class can be divided in the following groups:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Stubbing API</strong>: {@link #stubOut(Class...)}, {@link #stubOutClass(Class, String...)}, and
 * {@link #stubOutClass(Class, boolean, String...)}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Mockups API</strong> for state-oriented mocking: {@link MockUp}, {@link #setUpMocks(Object...)},
 * {@link #setUpMock(Class, Class)} and its several overloads, {@link #setUpStartupMocks(Object...)},
 * {@link #setUpMocksAndStubs(Class...)}, and {@link #tearDownMocks(Class...)} / {@link #tearDownMocks()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <strong>Proxy-based utilities</strong>:
 * {@link #newEmptyProxy(ClassLoader, Class)} and its overloads.
 * These are merely convenience methods that create empty implementation classes for one or more interfaces, where all
 * implemented methods do nothing beyond returning a default value according to the return type of each interface
 * method.
 * The created classes can be mocked through the Mockups API, and its instances passed to code under test.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * In the Tutorial:
 * <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/tutorial/StateBasedTesting.html">Writing state-based tests</a>,

    * with the same parameters and with {@code void} return type.

    * real class, including the real method corresponding to the current mock method. In this case, however, such calls
    * are not allowed by default because they lead to infinite recursion, with the mock calling itself indirectly

    * classes in the suite. Another way is by configuring what happens at startup through external means.
    * <p/>
    * There are three ways to set up mock classes at startup time:
    * <ol>
    * <li>Define a value for the "<code>jmockit-mocks</code>" system property, as a comma-separated list of fully
    * qualified class names.</li>
    * <li>Add a custom "<code>jmockit.properties</code>" file to the classpath, with an entry for the
    * "<code>jmockit-mocks</code>" (or just "<code>mocks</code>") property.
    * </li>
    * <li>Specify the "<code>-javaagent:jmockit.jar=&lt;agentArgs></code>" JVM argument, with "<code>agentArgs</code>"
    * containing one or more mock class names, separated by semicolons if more than one.
    * </li>
    * </ol>
    * Note that option two above makes it possible to package a whole set of reusable mock classes in a jar file,
    * provided it contains a suitable <code>jmockit.properties</code> file.
    * By simply adding the jar to the classpath <em>before</em> <code>jmockit.jar</code>, the specified mock classes
    * will be loaded and applied automatically on every test run, as soon as JMockit itself gets initialized.
