 * Indicates an instance field holding either a default return value for a given return type, or a checked exception

 * If the field is not explicitly assigned a value, then one will be created and assigned automatically, provided the
 * declared type of the field is a class having a no-args constructor.

 * no matching expectation is recorded.

 * If more than one input field of the <em>same</em> type is declared in an expectation block, then the first matching
 * invocation will take its result from the first field (in the textual order of declaration), the second one from the
 * second field, and so on until the last field of that type, which will then be used for all remaining invocations.
