/**
 * This class is JMockit's version of the JBoss AOP test from the
 * <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossaop/docs/2.0.0.GA/docs/aspect-framework/userguide/en/html/testing.html#testing1">
 * Injecting Mock Objects</a> section in the "Testing with AOP" chapter of the user guide for JBoss AOP 2.
 * <p/>
 * Notice how much simpler this is, when compared to the full code from the JBoss AOP original example.
 * With JMockit, there is no need to use the "Mock Maker" tool, or to write the {@code BankAccountDAOInterceptor} and
 * {@code MockService} classes; no configuration file (such as {@code jboss-aop.xml}) is required, and no build-time
 * bytecode modification tool (such as {@code aopc}) is used.
