<p>
   For a quick introduction to JMockit, go to the
   <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/gettingStarted.html" target="gettingStarted">Getting Started</a>
   page.
   For the motivations that led to the creation of the toolkit and a brief introduction to the main tools and APIs,
   check out the <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/about.html" target="homepage">About JMockit</a>
   page.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/tutorial.html" target="tutorial">JMockit Tutorial</a>
   contains an extensive description of all the available tools and APIs, with plenty of example code.
</p>
<p>
   The full distribution (in a zip file) contains several
   <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/samples.html" target="samples">sample test suites</a> written
   with the mocking APIs.
   There are individual test suites for comparison with other popular mocking tools, with the JMockit versions of the
   official example tests found on the Web for each other tool.
