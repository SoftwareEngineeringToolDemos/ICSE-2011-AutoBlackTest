The .tgz package is a 'generic Unix' package, as much as can possibly be expected.  It should
be able to run on almost any Unix OS with a minimum of fuss.

The main program is contained in the .jar file.  However, since Java programs can occasionally be
difficult to initialize properly, I have created a wrapper shell script to launch it.  This
is the file buddi.

You will probably have to modify this slightly to customize for your own machine.  I won't go into
details here, as if you are running on Unix, you probably already know what you are doing.  At a
high level, though, you will need to set the following options in the 'buddi' script:

1) Set the Java location
2) Set the JAR_DIR variable, where the .jar will be located
3) Verify the launch command.  This should be fine for most people, although you may want to 
modify some directories here.
